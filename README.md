[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/37d8faadd6fa45aba12e8a7b84929cd1)](https://www.codacy.com/app/alecc/pulse?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=alecc08/pulse&utm_campaign=badger)

### What this is
Angular + NodeJS dashboard project to get the "pulse" of a server. Call the pulse REST api to get what services are running and what their statuses are. 

### Why
I want to be able to monitor my home server from my PC without needing to check a bunch of different urls and ports.

### How
Angular app calls an express API to retrieve data on a server, such as which services are running, as well as providing URL's to access services which have their own web pages.
